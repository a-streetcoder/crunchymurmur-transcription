# CrunchyMurmur On-device Engine

`crunchymurmur-transcriber` is the shared Rust implementation behind
CrunchyMurmur's Node/Electron and Tauri desktop adapters. It validates an
authenticated Model Profile, keeps one Parakeet model warm, validates local WAV
input, downmixes channels, resamples common microphone rates to 16 kHz, and
returns a final speech or no-speech Transcript Outcome.

The crate contains both a reusable Rust library and the isolated JSON-lines
sidecar used by Node.js hosts. It does not capture a microphone, download a
model, send telemetry, or perform network requests.

This is an alpha interface. Start with the
[SDK guide](https://github.com/a-streetcoder/crunchymurmur-transcription/blob/main/docs/on-device-sdk.md)
and the host adapter documentation
before embedding it.
